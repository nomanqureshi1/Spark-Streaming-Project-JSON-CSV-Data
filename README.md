# Spark-Streaming-Project-JSON-CSV-Data
This project demonstrates a simple Spark Structured Streaming pipeline in Python.  Continuously generates dummy JSON data.  Spark reads the JSON files as a stream.  Processes data in real-time and writes it to an output folder as CSV files.  You can also read all processed data into a single DataFrame.
